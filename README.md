# Simple MIPS Processor

> A simple MIPS processor created in 2021 as a project for my assembly course in the British University in Dubai.

> Python was used in this project.

> The program simulates a single-cycle simple MIPS Processor.

> The program reads and writes registries and memories using MIPS commands.

> The program is entirely operated on the terminal.

> The program is comprised of one file.

> Enjoy :)
